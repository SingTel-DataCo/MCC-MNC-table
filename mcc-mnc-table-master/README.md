# mcc-mnc-table
Mobile Country Codes (MCC) and Mobile Network Codes (MNC) table in CSV, JSON and XML. Updated daily.

The table is pulled from http://mcc-mnc.com/.

# Contributing
Pull requests for the code (.py files) are welcome.

I do not accept any pull requests that directly modify the tables (.csv, .json and .xml files) in any way, as they are automatically generated by the Python scripts.
